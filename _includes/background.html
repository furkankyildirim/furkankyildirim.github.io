      I'm currently a Master of Science Student at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/" target="_blank">SabancÄ± University</a> and the Founder of
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://flio.ai/" target="_blank">Flio.ai</a>, a startup focused on solving complex logistics problems. 
      I previously worked as an Algorithm Engineer at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://getir.com/" target="_blank">Getir</a>, where I developed micro-services and business logic algorithms for efficient order delivery.

    <p>
      As a computer scientist and industrial engineer, I specialize in developing algorithms, mobile applications, web, and back-end projects. 
      I have comprehensive skills in data structures, algorithms, vehicle routing problems, optimization, software development, and team management. 
      My passion lies in creating efficient solutions that meet complex business requirements.

    <p>
      <strong>When I'm not coding or researching</strong>, I'm likely exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, 
      or expanding my knowledge in industrial engineering and optimization techniques.
